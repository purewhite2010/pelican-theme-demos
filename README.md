# Demo for Pelican Themes

This repository generates sites from all the themes in the theme repository (https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes). It also generates preview images for all the themes. This should make it easier to see what the themes look like.

It uses phantomjs for taking screenshots, and pelican to generate the sites. It
has 2 blog entries from the pelican-fresh-demo site, and a single Page entry to
demonstrate how a page entry appears.
